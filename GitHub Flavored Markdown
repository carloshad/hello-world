#### GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features,
many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues

Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.
